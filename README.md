# ECG-signal-processing
This project endeavours to design and implement an advanced signal processing 
framework for analysing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The framework 
employs techniques such as Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and 
Biorthogonal Wavelets to preprocess ECG data, effectively removing noise, 
including baseline wander, high-frequency artifacts, and powerline interference.
Utilizing a 9-level wavelet decomposition with the Biorthogonal 3.7 wavelet, 
the system successfully isolates and reconstructs the fundamental components 
of the ECG signal. Furthermore, it facilitates the detection of PQRST 
complexes, a pivotal step in extracting clinically relevant features such as heart 
rate and diagnosing cardiac anomalies. The project integrates automated 
algorithms for R-peak detection and heart rate estimation, thereby providing 
quantitative insights into cardiac health.
The methodology ensures accurate signal representation by preserving the 
morphological characteristics of ECG features while effectively eliminating 
noise. The framework possesses the potential to be applied in real-time 
monitoring systems, wearable health devices, and telemedicine platforms, 
thereby facilitating efficient and reliable cardiac diagnostics.
This research underscores the significance of wavelet-based approaches in 
biomedical signal processing and paves the way for future advancements in 
automated ECG analysis and predictive healthcare.
